The last JSON is in the [sota-extractor](https://github.com/algoagents/sota-extractor) format and the code
from there can be used to load in the JSON into a set of Python classes. 

At the moment, data is regenerated daily.

Part of the data is coming from the sources listed in the [sota-extractor README](https://github.com/algoagents/sota-extractor).
